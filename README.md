# Milestone 1 - Project ideas and diagrams

## Idea #1  Virtual pet on screen with LED interaction 
A virtual pet system that displays an animated character on p5.js canvas and responds to user input (Arduino button or touch sensor) - the pet’s mood changes based on how the user interacts with it and the LED lights provides physical feedback. 
- Feature include: virtual pet on screen, a p5.js animated character that displays different states (happy, neutral, sad, sleepy) and the states will change based on user interaction other than lack of interaction (pet neglect) 
- LED feedback: LEDs change color to represent pet’s mood (green= happy) (yellow = neutral) (red = sad) (blue = sleepy) — blinking patterns for additional expressiveness (eg. Slow pulse when sleepy) 
- User interaction: Button press to pet virtual character and the button triggers a feeding or playing animation that will affect the pet’s mood positively 
- Automated mood changes - if the user doesn’t interact with the pet for a set amount of time the pet’s mood will worsen which will trigger sad visuals and red LEDs.

## Idea #2 - Crochet Trainer 
As ambitious as this idea sounds, I want to implement my passion for crochet into this creative coding project. 

So this is a system that is designed to teach users to crochet specific stitches interactively. So this would combine instructions displayed on the screen with real-time feedback from user’s motions using sensors attached to the crochet hook. 

Arduino - inputs: motion sensors that are attached to the crochet hook to detect movement patterns 
LED indictors: light up green for correct motions and red for errors  - P5.js - animations, text-based guidance (“insert the hook here” “pull up a look”) , progress bar tracks how many stitches the user has completed and displays their progress.

## Idea #3 - mini traffic light project 

Create a traffic light simulation that changes colors in sequence or in manual control. LEDs for red, yellow and green and buttons to switch lights as the arduino components. For the p5.js aspect, there will be visual displays of cars/pedestrians reacting to the lights.  Just a simple yet function project, good for understanding timing and logic. 

1. Automatic Mode: The lights change in a timed sequence (Red → Green → Yellow → Red).
2. Manual Mode: A button allows the user to switch the lights manually.
3. Visual Feedback: Lights displayed both physically with LEDs and virtually using p5.js.
4. Optional Additions:
    * Sound effects for each light (e.g., a beep when transitioning).
    * Animated cars or pedestrians reacting to the lights on p5.js.
